# gitbook-CJKV
Gitbook about comparative study of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. 
Vietnamese is an important key to accessing the other three, commonly referred to only as CJK, but it is typically overlooked. 
Actually, all four major languages are totally separate language families, but there is an enormous amount of shared vocabulary between them.
