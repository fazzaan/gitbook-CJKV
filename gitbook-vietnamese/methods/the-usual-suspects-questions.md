* how old are you
* where are you from
* why are you in Viet Nam
* are you married
* do you have a lover
* do you have kids
* do you want to live in Viet Nam forever
* do you want to marry a Vietnamese
* where do you live right now
* etc

So... Learn how to answer these questions.

You'll learn a great deal of useful vocabulary & phrases just by answering these questions.

And those words & phrases will form your foundation.

Get good at answering.

Get good at pronouncing clearly.

With pronunciation, our goal is **always** to _**make it as easy as possible for others to understand us**_.

Why should they be making extra effort to understand us?

We are visitors, guests in their country. Make the effort.

Don't feel awkward or embarrassed for trying to mimic their sounds. This is the correct way to acquire the pronunciation & accent.

And also, learn how to ask these questions, too!

Such questions are normal for them in their culture. You are allowed to ask such things, especially if they have already asked you.

## How to ask & answer

### how old are you

Q: Bạn bao nhiêu tuổi?

A: Tôi ba mươi tuổi.

### where are you from

There are a few common variants of how this is asked.

A: Tôi đến từ nước Anh.

A: Tôi là người Anh / người nước Anh.

Q: Bạn từ nước nào?

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are from the USA, please make the effort to say _**Hoa Kỳ**_. The common Vietnamese name for the USA is "America country" which, if you are politically sensitive, is obviously wrong and is a key component of national & ethnic erasure. _**Hoa Kỳ**_ is just as well-known, so you can use it without confusion.
