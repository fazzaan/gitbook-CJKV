# Study Vietnamese with me

Here is a site full of things I've created and things I've discovered while studying Vietnamese.

I've mostly self-studied.

I use Duolingo purely as a vocabulary source, but it should be noted that it is mostly Ha Noi & northern Vietnamese, which is only a small part of the broad array of Vietnamese spoken in Viet Nam — despite most of the media being broadcasted using the Ha Noi dialect. I am a strong proponent of the idea that all accents & dialects are inherently correct _as long as the people using it are able to communicate effectively and without problematic levels of ambiguity_. The level of cohesion in a society (at whichever scale you choose to focus) is probably a good indicator of societal communicative quality.

I've made a bunch of resources as documents, and I'm transferring them onto this site for you to use.

I've also tried to transcribe some thoughts about the mental processes that I use for transitioning into speaking, pronouncing, learning, understanding and expressing in Vietnamese. It's hard to verbalize this stuff but I'm trying!
