# Tense particles

Firstly, tenses in Vietnamese are kept simple; that is, it is rare to hear the combination of tense particles in order to produce a complex tense such as the tenses we use in Indo-European languages.

You can combine tense particles and people will probably understand you, but it is not the done thing (in my experience thus far) and might get some laughs and raised eyebrows!

(I continue to construct complex tenses when speaking Vietnamese and haven't yet been told to stop.)

<table><thead><tr><th width="153"></th><th width="88"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>simple past</td><td>đã</td><td>"did"</td></tr><tr><td>simple future</td><td>sẽ</td><td>"will"</td></tr><tr><td>recent past</td><td>vừa</td><td>literally "just"</td></tr><tr><td>recent past</td><td>mới</td><td>literally "new"</td></tr><tr><td>extremely recent</td><td>vừa mới</td><td>"just now"</td></tr><tr><td>used to do</td><td>từng</td><td>could be once or many times or regularly</td></tr><tr><td>not yet</td><td>chưa</td><td>"yet", "not yet". Not a tense like how we conceive of tenses, but it does place the sentence/question in time.</td></tr></tbody></table>
