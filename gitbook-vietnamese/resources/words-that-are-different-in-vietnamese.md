# Words that are different in Vietnamese

A lot of verbs and adjectives in English are identical, or have grammatical variation.

While this is sometimes the case in Vietnamese, it is also extremely common to have different words. This is probably because there is no grammatical mutation in Vietnamese, and as there is also an enormous corpus of feeder languages, words from feeder languages and dialects are frequently utilised to convey the grammatical variations.

Sometimes, both words can operate in any grammatical position.

Sometimes, each word is bound only to one position.

Sometimes, one of the words can be used in different positions, while another word is only allowed in one position.

Here are a bunch of words that I’ve discovered and can recall.
